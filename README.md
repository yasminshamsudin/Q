This repository contains:
1. Scripts used with the Q MD program developed in the Åqvist lab
2. Q version 5.06 (parallell) previously compiled on Rackham, Uppmax, Uppsala Sweden.

The scripts are provided "as is" and can be used for preparing protein and ligand structures for MD simulations in Q, LIE calculations, and subsequent structural and energetic analyses.
Sample input files and scripts for running FEP and PMF simulations are also available.

The version in this repository were used in the Åqvist group at least until 2017.
